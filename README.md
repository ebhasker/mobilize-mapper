# mobilize-mapper
View Mobilize Events on a Map!

## Plan

* Use React without JSX so we don't need a build pipline for now (see https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html)
* Get API query functionality working first
* Write some tests (qunit to keep it easy), possibly TDD it
* Pick a mapping library (leaflet or similar?), show results on map
* Pick relevant fields for each event to display, lay them out in a basic manner
* Pick a styling/widget framework and make it look nice
* Add a Python webserver (bottle? flask?) if we get to the user session persistence stuff
